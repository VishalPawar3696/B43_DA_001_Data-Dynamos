# Power BI Project: Airbnb Data Analysis

# Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb pricing data using Power BI. The goal is to process, clean, and load the data into an SQL database and create a dynamic Power BI dashboard that updates automatically.

# Project Steps

# Step 1: Download and Prepare Dataset
# Download Data: Get the dataset from this link.
# Upload to Google Drive: Store the dataset for easy access.
# Load into Pandas: Use Python to read the dataset and clean it.

# Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values.
Normalize data types.
Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.

# Step 2: Load Data into SQL Database
# Set Up Database: Create an SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server).

Define Schema: Create tables based on data attributes.
Insert Data: Use Python (pandas & SQLAlchemy) to insert cleaned data.

# Step 3: Connect SQL to Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop.
Click on Get Data → Select SQL Server.
Enter server name & database credentials.
Click Load to import the data into Power BI.

#Step 4: Transform Data in Power BI
Go to "Home" → Click "Transform Data".
Perform any additional cleaning:
Remove unnecessary columns.
Change data types.
Create calculated columns if needed.

# Step 5: Create Visualizations

Bar Chart: Compare average prices for different room types.
Pie Chart: Show the percentage of shared vs. private rooms.
Line Chart: Show price trends based on person capacity.
Map Visualization: Display Airbnb listings geographically.
Filter Panel: Allow users to filter based on room type, price range, and cleanliness rating.

#Step 6: Publish Power BI Report
Click Publish in Power BI.
Upload the report to Power BI Service.
Share the report with others.

# Step 7: Enable Auto-Refresh in Power BI
Go to Power BI Service.
Open the report and navigate to "Datasets".
Click on Scheduled Refresh.
Enable auto-refresh and set it to Hourly/Daily.

# Step 8: Verify Dynamic Updates
Modify SQL Data: Change some values directly in the SQL table.
Check Power BI Dashboard: Ensure the changes reflect after the next refresh.
Deliverables

# SQL Database: Fully structured and populated.
Power BI Dashboard: Interactive and dynamically updating.
